Rescue Girlies
=============

<http://www.tpot.ca/>

Final Update: April 28, 2014

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Rescue Girlies is a fork of the SuperTux jump'n'run game. I made RG as 
  a Christmas gift for my children. Run, jump and think your way through 
  the campaign to save your loved ones. Make new friends, eat some
  cupcakes, and squish many badguys along the way!
  
  3 Story Scenes (One long, two short).
  9 Heavily Customized, RPG Side-Scroller Style, Story Based Levels.
  21 Bonus Levels.
  2 Hidden Levels.
  Tons of Secrets.
  Bajillions of Coins to Collect.
  New Abilities, Enemies, Locations, and Stuff to Spend Your Coins On.
  Custom graphics, sounds, and voice overs.
  
  
  
  RESCUE GIRLIES IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY VERSION OF SUPERTUX.
  
  
  
  RG has custom c++, scripting, and tilemaps, so the levels are not directly 
  iterchangable, at all. However, many Supertux levels will work with RG, 
  as seen in the (somewhat modified versions of) bonus levels taken
  directly from Supertux.

  The version you are playing is not entirely the same as the one my kids 
  play, due to this version being GPL compliant. Differences between my
  private version and the GPL version:
  
  - Music choices.
  - Non-free ambient sounds and other sound effects.
  - Pictures of my family were replaced with generic pictures.
  - Voice & Graphical cameo apperances by celebrities my kids enjoy
     were replaced (with my "voice acting" and "art", sorry) or removed.
     
  That's it. While I do believe these things in the private version really
  give the game a sense of sole or heart, I did my best to convey the
  same feeling in the GPL version. Replacing the sounds proved to be
  far more difficult than I had imaged, which is why I was not able to 
  release it at Christmas time. 


STORY
-----

- Nolok Takes More Power! -

 The evil king, Nolok, captures the mother and father of a family and 
 uses their rings of marriage power to finally capture his arch rival,
 Tux. The three daughters set off on a magical journey to reunite their
 family and rescue their captured hero. 

  

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
  Important documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.
  Please see them:

    README               - (This file.)  Game story, usage, rules and controls.
    COPYING              - The GNU General Public License, under whose terms
			   SuperTux is licensed. (Most of the data
			   subdirectory is also licensed under CC-by-SA)
    data/credits.txt     - Credits for people that contributed to the creation
                           of Rescue Girlies and SuperTux. (You can view these in the game 
			   menu as well.)
    tools/supertux-docs 	- documentation that came with the 0.3.3 SVN verison
						of Supertux that Rescue Girlies is based upon.
    tools/wiki		- Customized plain text copies of the Supertux wiki that I made 
				based upon my time working with the game engine and editor.


RUNNING THE GAME
----------------
  NOTE: This game was designed to be run in an 800x600 window. Resizing the
		the window or playing full screen is possible, but it WILL ruin the looks
		of the three story cut scenes. I did this, because my kids only play at
		that resolution and this game was made for them. :)

  System Requirements:
	GNU/Linux 32bit or 64bit Distribution
	OpenGL compliant Accelerated Graphics Processor (Nvidia / AMD/Ati / Intel)
  Recomended:
	CPU: Intel Core2 Quad / AMD Phenom II X4 or better
	RAM: 2GB DDR2
	VIDEO: Nvidia GeForce 8600GT / AMD Radeon HD5670 or better
	Operating System: Debian 7 Wheezy with XFCE desktop environment.
  Minimum:
	CPU: 1.8GHz Dual Core AMD or Intel
	RAM: 1GB RAM
	Video: Nvidia GeForce 6200 / AMD Radeon HD2000 / Intel HD Graphics 4000 (Ivy Bridge)
	Operating System: Lubuntu 11.04 (oldest thing I've tried that compiles/runs RG).

  Rescue Girlies / SuperTux makes use of proc to see where it is. In other words, it 
  does not have any need to be installed and can be run from anywhere. This makes
  it possible to click the executable in your filemanager (i.e. Thunar, PCmanFM,
  Nautilus, etc.) as opposed to many other Linux games.

  Options and profiles are saved in ~/.rescuegirlies. They will need to be edited 
   manually, unlike Supertux. I did this explicitely because my kids are ALWAYS
   messing up the options in Supertux through the in game menu (especially the
   language), so I removed them to avoid that possibility. Saves me some sanity,
   I hope... :)

  

PLAYING THE GAME
----------------
  Controls
  --------
  Both keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change the
  controls via the configuration file. 
  
  Actions & Abilities:
  
  Run, duck, crawl (move while ducking), jump, backflip, pick up objects, duck
  and pick up an object in front and below you, throw objects (bombs and blocks),
  and butt-jump (land hard on boxes/enemies to break them).
  
  Powerups:
  
  Clothing Chest: Change your outfit. Now you can backflip, butt-jump, and take 1
				1 hit from an enemy without dying.
				
  Cupcake Flower: Throw cupcakes at the enemy to kill them. Same as fire flower
				in Supertux and Super Mario Bros.
				
  Snowman: Thow snow balls at enemies to freeze them. Can be unfrozen with 
			cupcakes. While frozen, enemies are completely inert. Frozen
			bombs cannot be thrown, but can be carried, dropped, and stomped
			upon to make them explode.
			
 Invicible: Makes you invicible to enemies for a short time. However, some spikes
		   will kill you anyway, else the game would be very, very boring.

  The Esc key  is used to access the menu. In the menu you are able to purchase
  any of the above Powerups by spending the coins you have collected. The menu 
  can be navigated using the arrow keys or the mouse. 
  
  There is also a special surprise waiting to be discovered that you will use in two 
  different levels. Well, that is if you didn't already read about it on the Internet. :)

  In the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and the Enter key is pressed
  to begin playing a level. 
  

  Cheating: 
 
  Do it if it makes you happy - this is an open source, single player game. See the 
  config and profile files (noted above) for some pretty self explanitory details.


DEVELOPMENT STATUS
------------------
 Rescue Girlies was a "one off" game that was created for a single, one time purpose.
 The will be no further development of this game by its creator, me, R. Bassett Jr. That 
 said, you are able to play it, because I wanted to give back to the open source
 community that made my gift to my children possible. You're free to take what I've
 done with Rescue Girlies and use parts or all of it for your own purposes, be that 
 learning or creating your own game. 


THE END
-------

Thank you for trying Rescue Girlies. If you have any questions or comments, please
feel free to contact me at www.tpot.ca. 

Sincerely, 

R. Bassett Jr.
