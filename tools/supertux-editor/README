To use this, install the following Debian package: mono-complete

To run it, type:

mono supertux-editor.exe

If it complains, run it with this:

mono --runtime=v4.0 /full/path/to/file/supertux-editor.exe


Notes:

This editor has some quirks, but it's fully usable once you understand them. 

1. When entering values of objects (F6 screen) ALWAYS type the value, hit ENTER, put the cursor into a different field, hit ENTER, then click on a different tile map than the one that is currently selected. This will ensure the value you changed will actually get saved. Ignore and dismiss the error message that pops up - took me a while to understand and accept this! lol...

2. Your data folder is rg/data

3. Your executible is rg/rescuegirlies

4. When you are finished editing the path of a platform or tilemap, just F5 to flip over to the drawing mode. It's the easiest way to leave the path editing mode.

5. Sometimes, and I am not sure why, F5 mode stops drawing tiles when clicking. It's pretty rare, but it's happened a few times. Just hit F5, F6, F5 and it will come back to normal.

6. Zooming out past  a certain point removes the horizontal scrollbar. Just zoom back in to get it back. 

7. You can place and move objects ("objects", including tilemaps) outside of the pink box that represents the level boundries if you like.

6. When a tilemap is hidden from view in the editor, by using the eye icon, DO NOT TRY TO DRAW ON THAT TILEMAP in the F5 window. It will crash/close the program.

8. If you've messed up adding a new tile to the tile cataloge (images/tiles.strf), the editor will crash/close when you scroll to where it should be in the cataloge. 

9. Launching the editor from the command line rather than from an icon is handy for those times when you're having trouble finding a problem with a level.
