ScriptingScriptedObject


 Summary 

A ScriptedObject is basically a SuperTux object that can be scripted to move around and animate. Also handy for stationary decorations that you don't feel like adding to the tilemap!

NOTE: Scripted objects DO NOT MOVE unless both the physics AND the solid flags are true. Bit of a downer, because that causes them collide with the player and other objects. If you want to move an object behind or in front of the player without colliding with the player and not have to worry about physics, I suggest using a tilemap with a path (which can be scripted with the same methods as below). Moving tilemaps are nice, because they can have solid parts as well if you like. Do note that it's best to break up large images into 1 tile chunks, because the engine will not render a large image that is stored as one tile until the upper left corner is fully on the screen. It's a pain to paint a big image one tile at a time, but the end result is that it smoothly enters the screen rather than popping into view abruptly.
 
 Instances 

ScriptedObjects are created by being defined in level files. Each scripted object will be exposed under its name to the scripting engine. Access through the console is realised via the sector object. 
 Example 

Example of a definition: 
  (scriptedobject
    (x 2291)
    (y 1275)
    (name "SUPERTUX")
    (sprite "images/creatures/tux_big/tux.sprite")
    (layer 100)
    (visible #t)
    (physic-enabled #t)
    (solid #t)
  ) 
 

The above object will be exposed under the name SUPERTUX in the scripting engine. Example usage: 
  // This script will make tux look and walk left/right (this should make him appear
  //   "upset")
  SUPERTUX.set_action("stand-right");
  wait(2);
  SUPERTUX.set_velocity(200,0);
  wait(0.3);
  SUPERTUX.set_velocity(0,0);
  wait(0.4);
  SUPERTUX.set_action("stand-left");
  SUPERTUX.set_velocity(-200,0);
  wait(0.3);
 

The object can be accessed from the console sector.SUPERTUX. 
 
 Methods  
 
 set_action(string animation) 	 Activates the sprite's action specified in animation. 
 get_action() 	 Returns the name of the sprite's current action. 
 move(float x, float y) 	 Moves the object by x units to the right and y down relative to its current position. 
 set_pos(float x, float y) 	 Basically identical to move, except its relativity to the sector origin. 
 get_pos_x() 	 Returns the X coordinate of the object's position. 
 get_pos_y() 	 Returns the Y coordinate of the object's position. 
 set_velocity(float x, float y) 	 Makes the object move in a certain direction (with a certain speed) given by the x and y coordinates. 
 get_velocity_x() 	 Returns the X coordinate of the object's velocity. 
 get_velocity_y() 	 Returns the Y coordinate of the object's velocity. 
 set_visible(bool visible) 	 Shows or hides the object according to the value of visible. 
 is_visible() 	 Returns true if the object is visible, false otherwise. 
 set_solid(bool solid) 	 Makes the object solid according to the value of solid. 
 is_solid() 	 Returns true if the object is solid, false otherwise. 
 get_name() 	 Returns the name of the object
