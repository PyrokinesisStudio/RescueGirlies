Rescue Girlies is based upon the 0.3.3 SVN version of Supertux, which uses cmake/make.

Note: 
I did not try compiling RG for Windows at all, so I have no idea if it will work. 

==============


Prerequisites 

 32 Bit or 64 Bit GNU/Linux system
 gcc compiler & co (gcc, g++, binutils, glibc) 
 gettext 
 autoconf 
 cmake 
 SDL (*) 
 SDL-image (*) 
 PhysFS (*) 
 Ogg/Vorbis (*) 
 OpenGL (*) 
 OpenAL (*) 
 libcurl (*) (optional) 
 libboost (*) (SVN only) 
 libglew (*) (SVN only)

 Installed with Supertux package on Debian:
 libmikmod2
 libsdl-mixer1.2

You should make sure that you also have development headers and libraries installed for the tools marked with (*). 

Most distributions offer separate developer versions for these libraries.


Debian users should run 
apt-get install subversion autoconf automake jam g++ 
apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libphysfs-dev libvorbis-dev libogg-dev libopenal-dev libcurl3-dev


If you use Ubuntu 10.04 or newer, you can install the libraries very simply: 
apt-get build-dep supertux


Gentoo users should run 
emerge -avn subversion ftjam media-libs/openal physfs libsdl sdl-image libvorbis libogg curl


For Fedora, use yum and don't forget the development packages! 
yum install jam SDL SDL-devel SDL_image SDL_image-devel physfs physfs-devel openal openal-devel
(assuming gcc, gettext and autoconf are already installed)

Configuring and Compiling 

Rescue Girlies uses CMake to generate a set of Makefiles for the build process. To generate these Makefiles and build SuperTux, perform the following steps which are also described in INSTALL which comes in the source archive. 
 
 - `cd' to the directory where you unpacked the SuperTux source archive, i.e. to the directory containing `src' and `data'. 
 - I left an empty build directory your convience. cd into it.
 - Run `cmake -DDEBUG=ON ..' to create the Makefiles needed to build RG with debug options. If you are missing any libraries needed to build RG install those first, then try running CMake again. 
 - Type `make' to start the build process. TIP: Make is multithreaded and can compile faster on multiprocessor systems with make -j #, where # is the number of processors in your system +1.
 
Rescue Girlies does not need to be installed on the system, you can run it from its own directory. It will place a .rescsuegirlies directory in your home directory to store the config and profiles.
